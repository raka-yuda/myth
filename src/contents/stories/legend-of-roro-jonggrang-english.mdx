# The Curse of Roro Jonggrang

## Summary

In the ancient Javanese kingdom of Prambanan, a powerful prince named Bandung Bondowoso fell in love with a beautiful commoner named Roro Jonggrang. To win her hand in marriage, he was tasked with an impossible challenge – to build a thousand temples in just one night. Driven by his love and ambition, the prince sought the help of supernatural forces, setting in motion a chain of events that would leave a lasting legacy etched in stone.

## The Main Story

In the heart of Java, where the misty mountains meet the fertile plains, stood the mighty kingdom of Prambanan. It was a realm of grandeur and prosperity, ruled by the wise and just King Bondowoso. Among his many sons, Prince Bandung Bondowoso was the most daring and ambitious, renowned for his bravery and cunning in battle.

One fateful day, as the prince ventured into the nearby village, he encountered Roro Jonggrang, a maiden of unparalleled beauty and grace. Her radiant smile and gentle demeanor instantly captured his heart, and he knew that he must make her his bride. However, Roro Jonggrang was no ordinary commoner; she was a skilled craftsman, skilled in the art of sculpting and stonework.

Undeterred by her humble origins, Prince Bandung Bondowoso approached Roro Jonggrang and declared his intentions. Yet, the clever maiden was not easily swayed. She devised a seemingly impossible task for the prince – he must build a thousand temples in a single night, each adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures. If he failed, she would never be his.

Driven by his love and determination, the prince sought the aid of the mystical forces that dwelled in the shadows. He struck a deal with a powerful spirit, trading his soul for the ability to summon an army of demons to construct the temples. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the demons set to work, their claws and hammers chiseling away at the stone, erecting one temple after another with astonishing speed.

As the night wore on, Roro Jonggrang watched in awe as the temples took shape, their majestic spires piercing the starry sky. But deep within her heart, she harbored a secret fear – if the prince succeeded, she would be bound to him forever, forced to sacrifice her freedom and her dreams.

With the first rays of dawn creeping over the horizon, the prince's triumph seemed imminent. Only one temple remained unfinished. In a desperate act, Roro Jonggrang summoned her own powers and cast a spell, causing the rooster to crow prematurely, heralding the arrival of the new day.

The demons, bound by their pact, vanished in an instant, leaving the final temple incomplete. Furious at his failure, the prince confronted Roro Jonggrang, demanding an explanation. In a moment of defiance, she revealed her true intentions – she had never intended to become his bride, for her heart belonged to her craft and her freedom.

Enraged, the prince invoked the dark magic he had acquired, turning Roro Jonggrang into a stone sculpture, forever preserving her beauty and defiance. The incomplete temple became her eternal resting place, a testament to her unwavering spirit and the price of ambition.

To this day, the majestic temples of Prambanan stand as a reminder of the legend of Roro Jonggrang, a tale of love, sacrifice, and the enduring power of the human spirit.

## Moral Lesson

The legend of Roro Jonggrang teaches us valuable lessons about the consequences of ambition and the importance of respecting individual freedom.
