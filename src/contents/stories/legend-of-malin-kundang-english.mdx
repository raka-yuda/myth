# The Ungrateful Son: The Legend of Malin Kundang

## Summary

In the coastal village of Air Manis, a poor widow named Mande Rubayah raised her son, Malin Kundang, with unwavering love and sacrifice. Despite their humble circumstances, she instilled in him the values of gratitude and humility. However, as Malin Kundang grew older and ventured into the world, he became consumed by greed and ambition, forgetting the lessons his mother had taught him.

## The Main Story

Once upon a time, in the small village of Air Manis, lived a widow named Mande Rubayah and her son, Malin Kundang. They were poor but content, living a simple life by the sea. Mande Rubayah worked tirelessly to provide for her son, often going hungry to ensure he had enough to eat.

As Malin Kundang grew into a young man, he became restless and yearned for a life beyond the village's confines. Against his mother's wishes, he set sail on a merchant ship, determined to seek his fortune.

Years passed, and Mande Rubayah waited patiently for her son's return, her heart filled with hope and longing. One day, a magnificent ship arrived at the village harbor, and to her joy, she recognized her son standing on the deck, dressed in fine clothes and adorned with jewelry.

Overcome with emotion, Mande Rubayah rushed to the shore, waving and calling out to her son. But to her dismay, Malin Kundang did not recognize her. He had become wealthy and arrogant, ashamed of his humble beginnings.

"Old woman, step aside!" he shouted, refusing to acknowledge his own mother. "I have no poor relations!"

Mande Rubayah, heartbroken by her son's ingratitude and cruelty, fell to her knees and raised her hands to the heavens, uttering a curse upon her ungrateful son.

Suddenly, the skies darkened, and a deafening thunderclap echoed across the sea. Before Malin Kundang's horrified eyes, his magnificent ship began to turn to solid stone, trapping him and his crew forever in their petrified forms.

To this day, the legend of Malin Kundang lives on, with the rocky formation resembling a ship serving as a reminder of the consequences of ingratitude and disrespect towards one's parents.

## Moral Lesson

The legend of Malin Kundang teaches us the importance of gratitude, humility, and respect for our parents and elders. It serves as a cautionary tale against the dangers of greed, arrogance, and forgetting one's roots. No matter how successful or wealthy we become, we must never forget the sacrifices and love of those who nurtured and supported us along the way.
